Let me preface this blog post by saying i'm a pretty terrible writer, so this blog is also partly to hopefully help me improve my writing skills (I was always a maths guy in school).

## Beginnings

Originally i hail from the small island state of Tasmania. The tech scene here is virtually non-exisistent, making it challenging to find mentors or learning opportunities. However growing up i always had an interest in technology and i would always have so much fun experimiting and learning various things. My first foray into actual coding began when myspace was **king** of social media.There was countless hours spent playing with the HTML and CSS of not only my profile but also my friends.

During high school, I ventured into a side hustle of customizing Myspace profiles for others. It was during these Myspace days that my fascination with coding truly took flight. Then facebook took over and that was the end of my side hustle for a while.

Theres something magical about building, tinkering, and seeing the tangible results of my digital creations.Throughout the rest of my high school and college times i delved deeper in graphic design, something i still really enjoy doing but i recognized that it was more of a hobby than a full-time pursuit.

After i finished year 12 i got accepted an electrical apprenticeship. As i progressed in the field, i encountered programming in various forms, such as PLCs, controls, networking, and CCTV. This exposure reignited my interest in coding, inititaly it was just helping some clients adjust their existing websites with some HTML and CSS, which i still had a bit of a grasp upon since my myspace days. I loved what i was doing and i said to myself i want this to become my day job and from there i made the decision to go down the path of becoming a software engineer

## Changing Careers

They say career changes are often these days, but you dont see many electricains aged 26 change industries...<br/>
Fair to say there is some risks involved with what i am doing, but to be able to rock up and do something you enjoy each day is priceless to me.

I went about learning programming by myself, it's definitely one of the hardest if not the hardest thing i've ever undertaken. Having to not only study and learn these brand new concepts you also have to stay motivated and discilplined. I don't think i'd have been able to do it without 3 things Leon Noel told me.

1. Learning how to learn - Since it had been quite a few years since i'd studied i had no real idea how to approach it, even reflecting upon my past studies i really had no idea what i was doing. So i took a course on how to learn (LINK HERE). This course broke down some key concepts that been instrumental throughout my journey most namely chunking and spaced repitition.

2. Anki - A revolutionary program that transformed my study habits. I transitioned from inefficient note-taking to creating flashcards with Anki, leveraging its algorithm to schedule reviews, incorporating spaced repetition. (LINK) (LINK)

3. Looking after myself - Sounds pretty simple but it wasn't just about the study sessions; it was about finding moments of rest, practicing self-compassion, and acknowledging the progress, no matter how small. As long as i turn up daily and stay consistent i know in the long run i will be successfull and i think this applies to basically anything in life. (LINK)

While seemingly simple, these three principles were remarkably effective.

## Initial Studies

The start of my studies was quite easy, i was already well versed in HTML and CSS and i naively thought this was going to be a walk in the park.
However, delving into a real programming language like JavaScript was a rude awakening for me.

Having never used JavaScript or really any other programming language.I found myself overwhelmed by the vast array of new conceptsâ€”variables, functions, objects, loops, and more. Anki became my best friend; daily revisions gradually brought clarity. Focusing intensely on the fundamentals paid off. Proficiency in these foundational concepts across programming languages simplified subsequent learning, requiring only an understanding of syntax and language-specific quirks.

This is where anki came in, i would revise my anki everyday (i still do) and as the weeks progressed i was starting to get somewhere. For me i focused heavily on the fundamentals and i believe this has helped me out so much. Once you pick up these concepts that are common between all programming languages it becomes so much more simple. Since i know the fundamentals quite well, all that is need to learn another language is learning the syntax and some of the quirks.

If you can't already tell i like to try keep things as simple as i can, a teacher back in the day always told me to keep things simple and dont overcomplicate it, this is some of the best advice i have ever recieved and whether faced with challenges or problem-solving, i find that simplicity not only makes things more manageable but also enhances understanding and effectiveness.

## Parallels

As i progressed through my studies and started helping clients, i kept coming to the realisation that the software engineering industry is not to different to the electrical industry that i came from. Many things are shared between the industries and i can make many analogys to simplfy things for me and hopefully for you.

- Fitoff - This is the step where as electricians we install the fittings & fixtures that will be seen and be used, think of a light or a powerpoint, this relates to frontend in software engineering shaping the interface and user experience that end-users interact with. In both Fitoff and Frontend development, precision and attention to detail play a crucial role in delivering a polished and functional end result.

- Rough in - This is the preperation phase, where we set up the foundational infrastrucutre laying down the wiring and connections that will form the backbone of the entire system which will be mostly concealed, think of many electrical cables. Similarly, in software development, the backend is the behind-the-scenes architecture where databases, servers, and logic are established. In both rough in and backend development, meticulous planning and attention to detail are instrumental in laying the groundwork for a robust and seamless end product.

- Testing - This principle is highly transferable between industries. Just as an electrician rigorously tests wiring and connections for safety, software engineers conduct thorough testing to ensure correct and secure code. Testing, whether in electrical or software engineering, is foundational for safety, reliability, and delivering high-quality outcomes.

The overlapping principles between electrical and software engineering have not only simplified my grasp of their lifecycles but have also highlighted key transferable skills:

- Problem solving
- Importance of testing
- Attention to detail

## Current Endeavors and Future Aspirations

My current endeavors span a spectrum of software development, with a primary focus on creating impactful projects. From frontend design to crafting robust backend architectures and overseeing the development of full-stack applications, each project is a testament to my versatility in the field. Simultaneously, I actively engage with clients, collaborating to devise efficient solutions tailored to their unique needs. This hands-on experience not only hones my technical proficiency but also sharpens my ability to navigate and solve real-world problems.

I also want to get back to being more involved within the open-source community, being able to contribute and work collaborativly along side other engineers is something i love doing.

At the heart of my professional growth lies an unwavering commitment to continuous learning. In navigating the ever-shifting landscape of software engineering, I recognize that having solid fundamentals is key to not just adapting but leading at the forefront of technology. To sustain this momentum, I continue to delve into emerging technologies, embracing industry best practices, all while ensuring a strong foundation whilst actively seeking feedback from both my peers and the broader community

Beyond the realm of freelance work and personal projects, my sights are set on securing a full-time position. The pursuit of a professional role in software engineering is not just about employment; it's a quest to immerse myself in a collaborative environment, contribute meaningfully to larger initiatives, and continue the journey of learning and leveling up.

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the journey to becoming a software engineer has been
been long and had plenty of ups and downs and it's not over yet, but i would not change a thing. Having gone through the struggles of trying to make the simplest thing work but spending days debugging the issue has made me a better programmer (IYKYK). It's also been transformative, enriching, and filled with continuous learning and as i navigate this evolving landscape, I am excited about the endless possibilities and the contributions I can make to the ever-expanding realm of technology.
